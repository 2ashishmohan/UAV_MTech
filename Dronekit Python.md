Quick Start
===========

This topic shows how to quickly install a DroneKit-Python 
*development environment* and run a simple example to get 
vehicle attributes from a *simulated* Copter.


Installation
============

DroneKit-Python and the *dronekit-sitl simulator* are installed 
from **pip** on all platforms.

On Linux you will first need to install **pip** and **python-dev**:
    
.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev

    
**pip** is then used to install *dronekit* and *dronekit-sitl*.
Mac and Linux may require you to prefix these commands with ``sudo``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dronekit
    pip install dronekit-sitl

See :doc:`../develop/installation` and `dronekit-sitl <https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-sitl#dronekit-sitl>`_ 
for more detailed installation instructions.
